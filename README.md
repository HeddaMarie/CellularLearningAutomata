# One dimensional cellular learning automata.
This algorithm was developed by Hedda Marie Westlin and Rosy Oo as part of our bachelors thesis at the Living Technology Lab at Oslo Metropolitan university.


## Modes

- Discrete and gaussian reward-strategies
- Probabilistic mode supported
- Damaged cells supported

Feel free to use and modify, or create issues or pull requests.
We appreciate any contribution to the algorithm, or if you'd like to use it for your own projects or research.
